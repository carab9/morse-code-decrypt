# morse-code-decrypt
This project is a Morse Code decryption program.  It reads in a Morse Code encrypted binary file, Morse.bin, stores it in a database, and then decrypts it to the original text and print the decrypted text to stdout.

## Requirements
C++ and C++ libraries: iostream, string, fstream, vector, tuple, algorithm, iterator, bitset, sstream

## Technical Skills
Decryption algorithm for Morse Code encryption using C++ data structures, such as vector, tuple, bitset, sstream, iterator.

## Results
The decrypted text printed in stdout.
