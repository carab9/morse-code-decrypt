# morse-code-decrypt
This project is a Morse Code decryption program.  It reads in a encrypted binary file, Morse.bin, encrypted by Morse Code bit patterns, stores it in a database, and then decrypts it to the original text and prints the decrypted text to stdout.

## Requirements
C++ and C++ libraries: iostream, string, fstream, vector, tuple, algorithm, iterator, bitset, sstream, smart pointer.

## Technical Skills
Decryption algorithm for Morse Code encryption using C++ smart pointer, bitset (for binary operations), sstream, iterator, and also C++ STL containers, such as vector, and tuple.

## Results
The decrypted text printed in stdout.
